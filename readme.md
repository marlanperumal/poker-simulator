# Poker Simulator

## Requirements

* Python v3.5.x

## Usage

This module is not typically designed to be executed directly from the console, but the following two commands may be useful:

* `python Simlutor.py`
* `python UnitTests.py`

If these result in an error, you may need to edit your imports to remove any preceding dots. For example, change `import .Card from Card` in all your `*.py` files to `import Card from Card`. Please note that this may break other modules that use this module (so don't check that change in), but it will get it to work stand-alone.
